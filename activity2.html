    <h2>My Favorite Movies, Books, and TV Shows</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>The Shawshank Redemption (Movie)</b>
            <p>
                <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i> (1994), directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, is a timeless tale of hope, 
                friendship, and resilience. Set in Shawshank State Penitentiary, the film follows Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongly 
                convicted of murder, and his bond with Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman). Through exceptional storytelling and performances, 
                the movie explores the triumph of the human spirit in the face of despair. Robbins portrays quiet strength and dignity, while Freeman's 
                heartfelt narration and portrayal of Red add depth and warmth. A cinematic masterpiece, it celebrates hope as the ultimate form of freedom.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Ozark (TV Show)</b>
            <p>
                <i>Ozark</i> is a gripping crime drama that explores the descent of a seemingly ordinary family into the dangerous world of money laundering. 
                Starring Jason Bateman as financial planner Marty Byrde and Laura Linney as his wife, Wendy, the series masterfully balances intense suspense 
                with complex character development. Set against the backdrop of the Ozarks, the show delves into themes of morality, family, and survival, 
                with each twist raising the stakes. Bateman's understated performance contrasts perfectly with Linney's commanding presence, creating a dynamic 
                partnership. <i>Ozark</i> is a dark, riveting journey that keeps viewers on edge until the very end.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Breaking Bad (TV Show)</b>
            <p>
                <i>Breaking Bad</i> is a masterful crime drama that chronicles the transformation of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a high school chemistry teacher 
                turned methamphetamine kingpin, and his partner Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul). As one of Vince Gilligan's greatest achievements, the series explores 
                themes of morality, power, and consequence with unrelenting tension and depth. Cranston's brilliant portrayal of Walter's descent into darkness is 
                matched by Paul's raw and emotional performance as Jesse. With its gripping storytelling, exceptional character arcs, and stunning cinematography, 
                <i>Breaking Bad</i> stands as one of television's greatest achievements, delivering suspense and impact with every episode.
