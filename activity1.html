        I am a dedicated second-year Computer Science student specializing in <b>Data Science</b> at VIT Vellore University. 
        My academic journey has been focused on building a strong foundation in computational thinking, 
        and I am actively working on enhancing my <b>coding skills</b> to bring my ideas to life. 
        I am passionate about exploring the intersection of <b>technology</b> and data, and I believe that <b>data-driven insights</b> 
        have the potential to solve complex real-world problems.

        Beyond academics, I have a deep interest in <b>gaming</b>, which has honed my <b>problem-solving abilities</b>, 
        <i>strategic thinking</i>, and teamwork skills. Gaming isn't just a hobby for meâ€”it's a way to challenge my mind and stay sharp. 
        I find that the logical reasoning and quick decision-making required in games often mirror the challenges I encounter in programming 
        and <b>data analysis</b>.

    <p style="text-align: left; color: black; width: 1200px; font-size: large;">
        Currently, I am focused on improving my <b>coding skills</b> and expanding my knowledge in <b>data science tools</b> and technologies. 
        Every line of code I write brings me closer to building meaningful projects and contributing to the tech community. 
        I believe in continuous learning and strive to stay curious, motivated, and open to new opportunities for <b>growth</b> and collaboration.
