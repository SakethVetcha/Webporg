            I am a dedicated second-year Computer Science student specializing in 
            <b>Data Science</b> at VIT Vellore University. My academic journey has been focused on building a strong foundation in computational thinking, and I am actively working on enhancing my 
            <em>coding skills</em> to bring my ideas to life. I am passionate about exploring the intersection of 
            <b>technology</b> and data, and I believe that <b>data-driven insights</b> have the potential to solve complex real-world problems.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond academics, I have a deep interest in <b>gaming</b>, which has honed my 
            <b>problem-solving abilities</b>, <em>strategic thinking</em>, and teamwork skills. Gaming isn't just a hobby for meâ€”it's a way to challenge my mind and stay sharp. I find that the logical reasoning and quick decision-making required in games often mirror the challenges I encounter in programming and 
            <b>data analysis</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, I am focused on improving my <em>coding skills</em> and expanding my knowledge in 
            <b>data science tools</b> and technologies. Every line of code I write brings me closer to building meaningful projects and contributing to the tech community. I believe in continuous learning and strive to stay curious, motivated, and open to new opportunities for 
            <b>growth</b> and collaboration.
